# dbec (Detect Business Email Compromise)

The idea for this extension came from [Episode 141](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/141/) of Darknet Diaries when, toward the end of the interview, the host Jack says:

>"At a bare minimum, just show me a big, bright red banner on the e-mail that says, look out, this e-mail comes from a domain that was registered two days ago. That would be really cool."

## Installation

If you are interested in testing the `dbec` extension in its current form, you can follow these steps:

1. Fork or clone this repo onto your local machine
2. In Firefox: Open the [about:debugging](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/about_colon_debugging/index.html) page
3. click the "This Firefox" option
4. click the "Load Temporary Add-on" button
5. then select any file in the `dbec` extension directory

The extension now installs, and remains installed until you restart Firefox.
